# HRIS Data Validation & Attrition Analysis (SQL)

## Overview
This project focuses on validating and analyzing HR employee data using SQL. The goal is to identify data quality issues, understand attrition patterns, and produce reporting-ready outputs that could support HR operations, audits, or analytics workflows.

The work reflects common tasks involved in HRIS data support, reporting, and system validation.

## Dataset

- Demographics
- Job role and job level
- Compensation and tenure
- Work conditions (overtime, business travel)
- Attrition indicator

## Objectives
- Validate HR data for completeness and consistency
- Analyze attrition across job level, department, overtime, and tenure
- Create reusable SQL queries suitable for reporting or dashboards
- Document assumptions and logic used in analysis

## Key Activities
- Data profiling and validation using SQL
- Identification of missing, inconsistent, or out-of-range values
- Attrition analysis using 1/0 flag logic
- Calculation of attrition counts and rates
- Creation of structured, repeatable queries

## Tools Used
- SQL
- Excel / Power BI
- GitHub

## Example Use Cases
- HR data validation prior to reporting
- Attrition analysis for workforce planning
- Supporting HR dashboards or audits
- Pre-processing data for analytics tools
